# reconfigurations
This project is in shambles, but still has a ton of useful shit in some of the files. I still plan on working on this project, but will not activly focus on it. I probably will continue to put new stuff in [/scratch](scratch) however. 

Just a collection of some of the custom configurations, macros, useful tools, utilities, and random shit I've amassed over the years. All in one place. Also setup to allow multiple linux (I'm using CentOS 7) users to inherit the the same configs, but not globally, just for a small subset of users--in the developers group.
